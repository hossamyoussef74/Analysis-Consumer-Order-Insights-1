The purpose of this project is to create a dashboard for data analysis and visualization, enabling users to explore and gain insights from a dataset related to consumer orders. The dashboard's key objectives are to:

1. **Provide Data Insights:** The dashboard allows users to quickly access and visualize essential metrics such as profit, discount, and production cost, helping them understand the financial aspects of the orders.

2. **Support Data Filtering:** Users can filter the data based on specific criteria, including product, year, and month, enabling them to focus on particular segments of the dataset for in-depth analysis.

3. **Facilitate Decision-Making:** By presenting data in various charts and graphs, the dashboard assists decision-makers in making informed choices related to product performance, profitability, and discount strategies.

4. **Track Trends Over Time:** The dashboard includes charts that display trends in profit, discount, and production cost over both years and months, providing insights into seasonality and long-term performance.

5. **Compare Products:** Users can compare the profitability and production costs of different products through the "Bar Chart for Profit per Product" and "Column Chart for Production Cost per Product," aiding in product portfolio management.

In summary, the project's primary purpose is to empower users to analyze and understand consumer order data, make data-driven decisions, and gain insights into the financial aspects of their business operations.
